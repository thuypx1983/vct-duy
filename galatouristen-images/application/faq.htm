<br />
<font style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;">Viet Nam</font></div>

The dry season runs from November to April, and the rainy season lasts from May to October. In the north, the wet season is from May to September while the period of time from December to March is the driest of the year.</li>

<div style="text-align: justify;"><font style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;">Laos</font></div>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">The rainy season lasts from May through October with hot and humid weather. The dry season begins in November with a cooler average temperature giving way the hot and dry feeling during April and May.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>6.&nbsp; What level of comfort can I expect?</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">It may be varied depending on what kind of trips you have chosen. In all of our trekking trips we stay overnight with local families in a hilly and mountainous area. All of your necessities will be carried along with your prepared meals. Of course, we will also use local comfortable hotels whenever available. In beach holidays and other tours, we stay in local hotels with enthusiastic staffs and <strong>fully-equipped amenities. All you have to do is just enjoy yourself.</strong></li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>7. What is the accommodation like?</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Hotels range from normal to five-star. While Deluxe hotels are located only in major cities, warm and charming local family-run accommodations with varied levels of private facilities can be found throughout the country. In Galatourist tours, developed hotels are constantly applied in order to offer our clients the best available and most preferred accomodations.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>8. How safe is it?</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Above all, your safety is of paramount importance in all of our trips. Every aspect of your adventure is constantly reviewed by our local staffs, and our professional guides are fully conversant with the demand for traveling in remote and isolated regions.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>9. What about travel insurance?</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Travel insurance is compulsory for any participant. It is advised that all travelers should have travel insurance covered before your departure. This will be really helpful in case of medical emergency. The travel insurance will cover Hospital and Medical expenses related to accidents happening to victims during the Insurance period and/or unexpected illness arising during that period as well. You can consult some of the travel insurers.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>10. Do I need to have any vaccine shots before the trip?</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">No vaccination is officially required by Vietnamese authorities, however immunization against cholera, hepatitis, typhoid, tetanus, polio and Japanese encephalitis is advised. Please consult your doctors for further medical advice. Bringing mosquito repellent, wearing long-sleeved shirts &amp; slacks and avoiding perfume are also recommended. In addition to an ample supply of your prescribed drugs (and the prescription which can be filled in case your pills are lost or run out), you should bring medicines against such common diseases as headaches, diarrhea, constipation, insect bites, sore throats, eye drops, cuts, etc. Medical standards outside Hanoi, Saigon, Siemriep and Luangprabang are lower than those found in western countries.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>11. What about the food?</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Your good health is the top priority in all of our trips. We are fully aware of the healthy diet necessary for trekking, kayaking or touring activities. Therefore, we have arranged tasty and varied meals with plenty of fresh ingredients to meet your requirements the most effectively. All of our food is prepared by genius cooks who ensure high standards of hygiene and serve a sensible combination of local and Western dishes. We also cater for vegetarians and seafood non-eaters. When you have to choose your own meals, you can eat the well-cooked food at decent hotels and restaurants. While snacks may be offered everywhere, one never knows either the conditions under which they were prepared or the healthiness of such food. You may want to bring along dried fruits and other &quot;comforts&quot; for the bus ride. Note that there is a &quot;dining car&quot; on the train which serves drinks and light meals.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>12. Who is my guide?</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">Positive feedbacks from our clients have proved our right policy of employing local people as tourist guides. Our guides are young, open-minded, qualified and enthusiastic people who can meet your travel needs and provide you - the travelers with an overview of local history and culture. They are also curious about foreign cultures and keen on cultural exchange with visitors. They are there to make your trip successful and unforgettable.</li>
</ul>
<div style="text-align: justify;"><strong>13. What about &quot;Responsible Travel&quot;?</strong></div>
<ul>
    <li style="text-align: justify;">We highly commit to provide you with a friendly environment operation. &quot;Environmentally, culturally and socially responsible&quot; is our style of travel services, called 'Responsible Travel'. It involves working closely with local people and, where possible, training local people as trip guides and staffs about the ways to protect the environment and decisions that affect their future. Our mission is to conserve the areas we visit, keep them intact &amp; undestroyed by tourism and bring positive benefits to local communities.</li>
